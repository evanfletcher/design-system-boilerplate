	<h3 class="ds-h2">URLS</h3>
	<h4 class="ds-pt1">Keep it short</h4>
	<p>While a descriptive URL is important, minimizing length and trailing slashes will make your URLs easier to copy, paste, or remember in the rare case they were not bookmarked, and will be fully visible in the search results. Should be no more than 100 characters with stop words removed.</p>
	<textarea rows="3" class="ds-code">www.yoursite.com/category/subcategory/productpage/product
might be shortened to
www.yoursite.com/category/product</textarea>

	<h4 class="ds-pt1">Use keywords</h4>
	<p>If your page is targeting a specific term or phrase, make sure to include it in the URL. However, don’t go overboard by trying to stuff in multiple keywords for SEO purposes; overuse will result in less usable URLs and can trip spam filters.</p>
	<textarea rows="3" class="ds-code">www.yoursite.com/dog-leashes-that-are-blue/blue-dog-leashes
might be better as
www.yoursite.com/leashes/blue-dog-leashes</textarea>

	<h4 class="ds-pt1">Be descriptive</h4>
	<p>Rather than selecting numbers or meaningless figures to categorize information, use real words and remove any special characters.</p>
	<textarea rows="7" class="ds-code">www.yoursite.com/category/item?23434
should be rewritten to
www.yoursite.com/category/dog-leashes
Remove Special Characters
www.yoursite.com/category/john's-leashes
should be rewritten to
www.yoursite.com/category/johns-leashes</textarea>

	<h4 class="ds-pt1">Use hyphens to separate words</h4>
	<p>Not all of the search engines interpret separators accurately like “_”, “+”, or “%20” so use the hyphen “-” character to separate words in a URL.</p>
	<textarea rows="3" class="ds-code">www.yoursite.com/category/dog+leashes
should be rewritten to
www.yoursite.com/category/dog-leashes</textarea>

	<h4 class="ds-pt1">Keep it lowercase</h4>
	<p>Not all the search engines are case sensitive so www.yoursite.com/dog and www.yoursite.com/Dog can be seen as different URLs by some of the search engines.</p>
	<textarea rows="3" class="ds-code">www.yoursite.com/category/Johns-Leashes
should be rewritten to
www.yoursite.com/category/johns-leashes</textarea>

	<h4 class="ds-pt1">Remove stop words</h4>
	<p>Stop words are very common words or adjectives that can hinder your SEO efforts. Words such as, ‘of ‘ , ‘or’, ‘the’ etc. interfere with your SEO efforts because they use up precious character space, especially when creating URLs. For your WordPress permalinks, there are plugins (such as Yoast SEO plugin) that have the option to do this automatically.</p>
	<textarea rows="3" class="ds-code">www.yoursite.com/category1/the-page-and-dog-name
becomes
www.yoursite.com/category1/page-dog-name</textarea>

	<h4 class="ds-pt1">Keep it 2 levels or less</h4>
	<p>Level 1 should be the site section/category. Level 2 should be the sub-section/second category</p>
	<textarea rows="3" class="ds-code">www.yoursite.com/category1/page-name (Good)
www.yoursite.com/category1/category2/page-name (OK)
www.yoursite.com/category1/category2/catetory3/page-name (Bad)</textarea>
