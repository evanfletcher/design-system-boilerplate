    <p class="ds-lead ds-pt1 ds-txt">When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Get tough with it, get strong. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera.</p>
    <p class=" ds-txt">I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. Here we're limited by the time we have. Let your heart be your guide. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends.</p>
